# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Prebuilt release WITHOUT the eGPU "big model" artifacts.
#
# Same as build_release.sh (rewrites git history with rm -rf .git, force-pushes
# the egpucp branch and deletes release/), plus it keeps two things out of the
# published branch:
#
#   1. eGPU big-model artifacts
#      openpilot/selfdrive/modeld/models/big_driving_*      (~750MB)
#      openpilot/selfdrive/modeld/models/.big_model_build_stamp
#      They are archived to /data/bigmodel_backup_<date>.tar.gz first, then
#      moved out of the tree, then restored locally after the push.
#
#   2. local backup dirs that would otherwise be swept in by `git add -f .`
#      (see LOCAL_EXCLUDE_PATHS below, e.g. amapnavi/nav_params.json)
#      Also moved out and restored afterwards.
#
# Why a release without the big model still runs:
#   launch_chffrplus.sh -> prepare_big_model_if_needed() calls
#   helpers.usbgpu_present(), which looks for the USB eGPU bridge
#   (VID:PID ADD1:0001 / 3801:0001 at >=5Gbps). With no eGPU attached the whole
#   path returns early, and invalidate_modeld_build_if_needed() skips the
#   big-model stamp check because BIG_MODEL_SHA stays empty. The small models
#   (driving_tinygrad.pkl.chunk*, dmonitoring_model_*, dm_warp_*) and
#   tg_input_devices.json are kept, which is what that check actually requires.
#
# Restoring the big model on another device (needs the tar.gz, e.g. over scp):
#   scp /data/bigmodel_backup_XXXX.tar.gz comma@<device>:/data/
#   ssh comma@<device> 'tar xzf /data/bigmodel_backup_XXXX.tar.gz -C /data/openpilot'
#   then reboot.  (Paths inside the archive are relative to /data/openpilot.)
#
# Set SKIP_CONFIRM=1 to run unattended, TOKEN=xxx to avoid the
# interactive credential prompt on push.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Local paths (relative to $BUILD_DIR) that must NOT be published. Space
# separated. Everything listed here is moved aside and restored afterwards.
#
# 注意：`git add -f .` 会无视所有 .gitignore（根目录和各模块的），所以仅仅写进
# .gitignore 是无效的 —— 运行时写在源码目录里的文件必须靠"移出目录树"来排除。
